## Depth Analisys
The penetration depth of an electromagnetic (EM) wave in water can be determined by calculating the attenuation coefficient and using it in an exponential decay formula. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Attenuation Coefficient:

The attenuation coefficient (α) describes how quickly the intensity of the EM wave weakens as it travels through the water. It depends on both the frequency of the wave and the properties of the water, specifically its permittivity (ε) and conductivity (σ).

Here's a formula to calculate the attenuation coefficient:

α = √(2πfμσ)

where:

α is the attenuation coefficient (Np/m)
f is the frequency of the EM wave (Hz)
μ is the permeability of water (approximately equal to the permeability of free space, μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m)
σ is the conductivity of water (S/m)
2. Penetration Depth:

The penetration depth (δ) is the distance at which the intensity of the EM wave has decayed to 1/e (around 37%) of its original intensity. It can be calculated using the following formula:

δ = 1 / α

Properties of Water:
Conductivity (σ) of water varies depending on factors like salinity and temperature, but a typical value is around 4.0 × 10⁻⁶ S/m for freshwater.
For saltwater sigma = 5 S/m

For f= 2450 -> penetration = 3.3 meters
